\chapter*{Abstract}
The Skip-gram Model with negative sampling is an effective algorithm to create word embeddings. While a lot of effort has gone into increasing the throughput of words of the model, not much work has gone into optimizing the convergence time. Our work focused on the latter. We used two techniques to achieve a better convergence time, namely advanced optimizers and input shuffling. We did achieve to decrease the convergence time of the skip-gtram model from 4(Gensim) to 2, by combining adam as an optimizer and shuffling the input at the same time.
