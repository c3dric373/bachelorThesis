%Discuss the results. What is the outcome of your experimetns?

In this section we will compare our work to related work, try to make sense out of our results, discuss some challenges faced and finally possible future work. 
\section{Related Work}
In this section we will compare our work to related work, we will first compare us to the baseline model, the original c implementation from Mikolov et al \citep{Mikolov}. We will then compare our self to Gensim, we do this because Gensim allowed us to easily and fastly compute the embeddings, while having access to the loss, and being a python implementaion made everything easier.
