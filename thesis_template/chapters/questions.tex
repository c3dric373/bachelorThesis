\chapter{Research Questions}\label{chap:questions}

This paper will address the following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can the convergence time of the skip Gram Model be optimized by the use of advanced optimizers, while at the same time maintaining it's accuracy? 
\item Can the convergence time of the skip Gram Model be optimized by the use of input shuffling, while at the same time maintaining it's accuracy? 
\end{enumerate}
