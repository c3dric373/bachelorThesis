Insert a short introduction to word2vec. and quickly talk about machine learning blablbablah. 


Machine learning is the science of algorithms the execution of a certain task, for example the classification of images into categories. The goal is that after a training period the model will be able to execute the task. The training is done on a so called training dataset, after sufficient training samples the model will have learned the appropriate task and will be able to perform well on the wanted task.
