Insert a short introduction to word2vec. and quickly talk about machine learning blablbablah. 


Machine learning is the science of algorithms the execution of a certain task, for example the classification of images into categories. The goal is that after a training period the model will be able to execute the task. The training is done on a so called training dataset, after sufficient training samples the model will have learned the appropriate task and will be able to perform well on the wanted task. An application for machine learning are word embeddings. Word embeddings are vectors that represent words. This is usually done in a one hot manner. For a vocabulary of size $n$, we will create $n$ vectors with dimension $n$. Each word will recieve an integer as an $id$. And the vector representation of the word will be as follows: every dimension of the vector will be $0$, except for the one wich is equal to the $id$ which will be $1$.
